The builtin Iguana Tools repository contains example channels that demonstrate modules containing various useful tools we have developed over the years. This includes things like: date parsing, filtering for duplicate messages, retrying intermittent errors (like a lost database connection), send a rich HTML email with attachments, etc.

Please see the <a href="http://help.interfaceware.com/category/building-interfaces/repositories/builtin-iguanatools">documentation on the Iguana Tools repo</a> in our wiki.
